How strict is your companies AUP (acceptable use policy)?
From my experience, I have seen everything underneath the sun.
Strict --> We have a set of applications, and you can only install from this list.
Too relaxed --> As long as they arent putting us at risk, we dont intervene...we had a user watching porn weekly on his laptop but CISO did not want to do anything..this was a weird one.
Middle ground --> We are all adults, dont download suspicious tools but we arent going to babysit everything you install.
What does your company do? What's your opinion?
I personally like the middle ground but recently there's been an uptick in downloading jigglers/tor/browsers other than the main 3...and I'm getting to the point where I may have to go down the strict path.
