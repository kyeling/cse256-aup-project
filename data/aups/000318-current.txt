An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is a document setting out the permitted purposes/activities/uses a network, website/platform can be applied towards. Priority is often placed on reading Privacy and Cookies Policies hence, not much attention is paid to the Acceptable Use Policy.The importance of reading an AUP was highlighted in the recent SUMMARY OF THE PAYSTACK SAGAA Paystack user intended to use the platform to receive payment for sex work/orgies. Paystack (the Company) disallowed. In disabling her Paystack account, the Company drew her attention to Section 2 of the Paystack Acceptable Use Policy which states that "Paystack may not be used in connection with any product, service, transaction or activity that relates to the sale and/or purchase of certain sexually oriented materials or services".REASONS WHY COMPANIES PLACE RESTRICTIONS IN THEIR ACCEPTABLE USE POLICYSome of these reasons are:Compliance with the law;Limitation of risk exposures in line with risk appetiteBuilding of a brand to attract diverse investors and partnersProtection of ongoing contracts containing pull-out clauses where either party's ethical practice taints the other party.PREPARING A SUITABLE ACCEPTABLE USE POLICYThe following tips aid the preparation of a suitable acceptable use policy:It should be directed towards acts and not towards individuals or class of individuals;It should be clear and unequivocal;It should state the consequence for breach of any specified term or class of termsIf an updated Acceptable Use Policy is to be applied retrospectively, then users caught up by the updated policy should be given a fair option of switching/adjusting/terminating without consequences.QUESTION OF THE DAY: When last did you read the Acceptable Use Policy/Community Guidelines of any platform you intend using?
