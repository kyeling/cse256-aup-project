Procedure
Acceptable Use and Security Requirements of Computing Resources at GitLab
GitLab-managed assets are provided to conduct GitLab business, with consideration given for limited personal use subject to any conflicting statements contained in individual employment contracts. Our company uses global electronic communications and resources as routine parts of our business activities. It is essential that electronic resources used to perform company business are protected to ensure that these resources are accessible for business purposes and operated in a cost-effective manner, that our company’s reputation is protected, and that we minimize the potential for legal risk.
Those receiving GitLab-provided assets are responsible for exercising good judgment when using GitLab-managed computers and accessing GitLab-managed data.
As per the  outlined in our handbook, evidence of device encryption and device serial number must be provided to IT Ops prior to the completion of onboarding period.
We are currently using JAMF as our endpoint management solution for Mac laptops. All Mac laptops procured by GitLab will come configured with . GitLab team members procuring and expensing Mac Laptops will require  to be installed as part of their .
Security and Proprietary Information
All GitLab data is categorized and must be handled in accordance with the . All computing assets that connect to any part of the GitLab network, or 3rd party services that are used by GitLab, must comply with the applicable standards.
Freeware, Browser Extensions, Add-ons and Plugins
can pose a risk to GitLab as they may contain viruses, spyware or adware. The use of freeware could result in the loss of GitLab data and the inability to protect the data in accordance with GitLab security and privacy requirements. Not all freeware contains malware, but team members should carefully consider the terms of service and  that will be shared before installing anything on your computer.
Security reserves the right to execute security reviews against this software and dissallow use if they do not meet GitLab's . Further, you must receive full GitLab Security and Privacy approval before transmitting any data that may be  to a software provider.
Unacceptable Use
Team members and contractors may not use GitLab-managed resources for activities that are illegal or prohibited under applicable law, no matter the circumstances.
Security requirements for GitLab production and corporate environments and on GitLab-managed assets must not be disabled without security approval via the .
Unacceptable System and Network Activities
Prohibited system and network activities include, but are not limited to, the following:
Violations of the rights of any person or company protected by copyright, trade secret, patent or other intellectual property, or similar laws or regulations.
Unauthorized copying, distribution, or use of copyrighted material.
Exporting software, technical information, encryption software, or technology in violation of international or national export control laws.
Intentional introduction of malicious programs into GitLab networks or any GitLab-managed computing device.
Intentional misuse of any GitLab-managed computing device or GitLab networks (e.g. for cryptocurrency mining, botnet control, etc.).
Sharing your credentials for any GitLab-managed computer or 3rd party service that GitLab uses with others, or allowing use of your account or a GitLab-managed computer by others. This prohibition does not apply to single-sign-on or similar technologies, the use of which is approved.
Using a GitLab computing asset to procure or transmit material that is in violation of sexual harassment policies or that creates a hostile workplace.
Making fraudulent offers of products, items, or services originating from any GitLab account.
Intentionally accessing data or logging into a computer or account that the team member or contractor is not authorized to access, or disrupting network communication, computer processing, or access.
Executing any form of network monitoring that intercepts data not intended for the team member’s or contractor's computer, except when troubleshooting networking issues for the benefit of GitLab.
Circumventing user authentication or security of any computer host, network, or account used by GitLab.
Tunneling between network segments or security zones (e.g., gprd, gstg, ops, ci), except when troubleshooting issues for the benefit of GitLab.
Given the potential sensitivity of the data contained in screenshot images, the use of tools that capture and share screenshots to hosted sites online is prohibited without the explicit approval of the Security and Legal Departments. Screenshots should be stored locally or within Google drive folders associated with your GitLab.com account. Access to these drives and files should be managed in accordance with our , and handled according to our . Tools such as , where upload functionality cannot be disabled and could result in inadvertant uploads, should not be used.
The use of high risk remote administration tools, such as TeamViewer and AnyDesk, which are  to gain and remotely control systems.
Unacceptable Email and Communications Activities
Forwarding of confidential business emails or documents to personal external email addresses is prohibited.
Note: GitLab may retrieve messages from archives and servers without prior notice if GitLab has sufficient reason to do so. If deemed necessary, this investigation will be conducted with the knowledge and approval of the Security, People Business Partners, and Legal Departments.
In addition to following the , when utilizing social media think about the effects of statements that you make. Keep in mind that these transmissions are permanent and easily transferable, and can affect our company’s reputation and relationships with team members and customers. When using social media tools like blogs, Facebook, Twitter or wikis, ensure that you do not make comments on behalf of GitLab without proper authorization. Also, you must not disclose our company’s confidential or proprietary information about our business, our suppliers, or our customers.
Return of GitLab-Owned Assets
All GitLab-owned computing resources must be  upon separation from the company.
Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD)
As a general rule, non-company devices are not permitted to access company assets. While there are some exceptions listed below, access to RED classified data is, as defined by the , still prohibited.
The exceptions are as follows:
Personal Mobile Phone and Tablet Usage
All personal mobile computing devices used to access GitLab-managed data, including but not limited to email and GitLab.com, must be passcode-enabled. 2FA will be enforced by the Security team for all employee and contractor GitLab.com and Google Workspace accounts. Mobile computing best practices dictate that these devices should be running the latest version of the operating system available, and all new patches applied. For assistance with determining the suitability of your mobile device, please contact the Security Team.
Unable to Use Company Laptop
For new employees who have not received a company laptop, there are  for using non-company devices.
The same exception processes apply in the case of a corporate laptop being unavailable or unusable due to loss, theft or disrepair. See  for additional information. You must open . While the exception processes are considered a temporary solution, you still need to make sure the non-company system meets , and a Microsoft Windows system is still not allowed access under any circumstances.
Mobile Messaging
All GitLab-related conversations need to take place in Slack. It is strongly recommended that the official Slack application, or Slack web application, are used for mobile messaging. Downloads are available for  and . While it may be more convenient to use an integrated chat application that puts all of your conversations in one place, the use of these applications can unintentionally lead to work-related conversations crossing platforms, or being sent to external contacts. The use of Slack for all work communications assists with our security and compliance efforts. For example, in the case of an incident response issue, it may be necessary to review a conversation to understand the order in which events occurred, or to provide evidence that the chain of custody has been maintained for forensic evidence during a handoff.
For , and as a back-up to Slack, we prefer Zoom. Zoom chats are an acceptable alternative to Slack when in a video call. If the conversation is interesting to others or may be needed for a retrospective, consider recording the call.
Use of External Media on Company Assets
The use of removable and external storage devices such as USB flash drives and external backup drives on company-managed devices is not officially sanctioned. If there is a business need for the use of an external storage device, such as a flash drive or an external hard drive on company devices, please contact the Security Team to determine the most suitable encryption-enabled device. All external and removable storage devices must be encrypted and protected by a passcode.
Use of file sharing services other than Google Drive
Creating an account with, or using, a file sharing service other than Google Drive for sharing GitLab-related files with other team members or those external to GitLab is not permitted unless an exception has been granted. To obtain an exception create an  outlining the business case, and do not proceed until the exception has been granted.
When creating an account with and using a file sharing service other that Google Drive, team members must:
Where available, use the Sign in with Google single sign-on option using a GitLab Google Workspace account, rather than creating an account using a GitLab (or other provider) email address and password.
Only upload files directly to shared folders created by those external to GitLab and do not upload files to the personal area of the file sharing service.
Remove all files and close the account when the file sharing service is no longer needed.
Lost or Stolen Procedures
GitLab provides a panic@gitlab.com email address and a  for team members to use in situations that require an immediate security response. Should a team member lose a device such as a thumb drive, Yubikey, mobile phone, tablet, laptop, etc. that contains their credentials or other GitLab-sensitive data, they should send an email to panic@gitlab.com right away. When the production and security teams receive an email sent to this address it will be handled immediately. Using this address provides an excellent way to limit the damage caused by a loss of one of these devices.
GitLab reserves the right to request documentation of the theft and/or a related police report in the case of a stolen laptop.
Policy Compliance
Compliance with this policy will be verified through various methods, including but not limited to, automated reporting, audits, and feedback to the policy owner.
Any team member or contractor found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, or contractual agreement.
Consultations

Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be approved by Security, Legal and PeopleOps Departments.
