Chicago, Illinois
24 Yrs Experience
Licensed in IL
University of Illinois College of Law
I received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Northwestern University in 1996 and then got my JD at  University of Illinois College of Law where in 1999.  I have been a lawyer helping people with legal issues in the United States and Internationally since then.  That includes litigation as well as contracts/transactions.
I am currently licensed and authorized to practice before the Illinois courts and the United States’ District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.   Internationally I am one of a select few American attorneys licensed and authorized to practice before the United Nations ICTY/IRMCT, the International Criminal Court,  and the State Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Clients have retained me internationally to alongside local counsel in several European countries, as well as Australia and Africa in private legal matters.  I also have been appointed by the United Nations to represent persons at the ICTY/IRMCT in addition to being chosen by indigent accused to represent them.
Since 2009 my law firm has handled domestic and international cases, including Trial litigation (including Commercial, Premises Liability, Personal Injury, Criminal Defense, and General Litigation), as well as Transactional work (Contracts, Corporate formation, and Real Estate Transactions).
I have been honored for my work by my peers who voted for me, and I served as President of the ADC-ICT (the Official Bar Association of Practitioners before the UN ICTY and UN IRMCT in The Hague) previously, and now am serving a term on the Executive Board.  I also am elected to serve key roles in the ICCBA (that is the bar association at the International Criminal Court in The Hague).
I enjoy helping less experienced practitioners and students evolve and improve.  I served as an instructor/lecturer on Oral Advocacy and Trial Practice for the participants of the ADC-ICT & ICLB Mock Trial since 2014, and has presented Advocacy Training lectures for the ADC-ICT on several topics as well as regularly lecturing to visiting University and Bar groups from around the world.
If you or a loved one have a legal matter of importance, let's see if I can help you with it!
