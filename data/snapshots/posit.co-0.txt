Introduction
This Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) sets forth terms and conditions for acceptable access and use of Posit Software, PBC’s (“Posit”, “we” or “us”) (formerly known as RStudio, PBC) websites and services (collectively, “Services”) by authorized customers and their users (collectively, “Users”) and supplements any written agreement between Posit and a User. This AUP is not meant to be exhaustive, but sets forth examples of conduct deemed by Posit to be inappropriate, improper or harmful to Posit’s network and Services and thereby prohibited. The restrictions set forth in this AUP shall apply to a User’s employees and any other person or entity that is provided access to the Posit Services directly or indirectly by a User (the “Affiliates”). By accessing or using the Services, each User acknowledges that it is authorized to enter into this AUP and has read, understood and agrees to comply with the terms of this AUP, will cause its Affiliates to comply with this AUP, and will be responsible for violations of this AUP by its Affiliates. If User does not agree to this AUP, then do not use the Services.
We reserve the right to modify this AUP from time to time in our sole discretion without notice; such changes will take effect upon the posting of such revised terms on this website. Accordingly, we recommend that Users check this AUP periodically. A User’s continued access or use of the Services after the posting of such revised terms constitutes the User’s agreement to comply with and to be bound by such revised terms. In the event of any conflict between this AUP and any other policy or agreement referenced herein, this AUP shall govern in the absence of specific language to the contrary in such policy or agreement.

User may only use the Services in accordance with this AUP, the Posit Terms of Use at https://posit.co/about/terms-of-use/ and your end user agreement with Posit.
