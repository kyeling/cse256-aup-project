The MC network may be used only for lawful purposes. Transmission, distribution or storage of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, defamatory, threatening, unlawful or in any way constitutes or encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense.
Inappropriate and unacceptable conduct also includes initiating, perpetuating or participating in malicious activities, including, but not limited to, an illegal scheme, spidering, harvesting, use of spyware, falsifying references to MC or impersonating any other person or entity.
