A few examples of such worms are: Nachi, MSBlaster and Sasser. Any computer that has one of these viruses will immediately infect other computers on the network that do not have the proper security measures in place.Benefits to CustomersBy TELUS protecting its network, customers receive additional protection against hackers, viruses and spam as a by-productInhibiting the spread of email viruses. Most email viruses have built-in email SMTP engines which allow viruses to email themselves to all the recipients in an address book without the user knowing; by TELUS blocking outbound SMTP traffic if a customer has an email virus it will not be able to spread itself to othersReduced Spam. By TELUS blocking outbound port 25 (SMTP), customers machines who have a virus whose goal is to turn the PC into a "zombie" machine will no longer flood the internet with millions of Spam messages. This helps significantly reduce Spam, especially considering that 95% of the world’s Spam originates from 'zombie' boxesCustomers who neglect, are not aware of, or simply do not update their Windows software will no longer be as vulnerable. The security policy blocks how hackers and viruses exploit the security issues in Windows. This is not an alternative to customers updating their operating systems; customers should still keep their Windows Operating Systems up to dateTELUS is not guaranteeing in anyway full protection of the customer’s computer but simply providing security for the TELUS network which consequently provides for a higher level of protection for TELUS customers. This policy is in no way a guarantee that customers’ computers won't get exploited by other meansWhat are Internet Ports?All programs that connect to the Internet use a specified "port". You can think of a port as a small part of your ADSL/Network connection and there are thousands of these "ports". All programs connect on various ports to the TELUS network. For example, if you are using Internet Explorer you are browsing the web on port 80.What Ports are TELUS blocking?The following ports will have inbound (ingress) and in some cases outbound traffic blocked:TCP 21 (ftp)Customers running an FTP server will no longer be able to have Internet users connect to their serverThis prevents computers to be used as FTP servers to store illegal files.TCP 25 (smtp)Customers running a SMTP mail server will no longer be able to receive e-mail requests, nor will it allow outbound traffic for mail servers external to the TELUS.NET, TELUS IDCs and Hostopia networks on port 25This prevents mail servers that operate as an open relay. Open relays are used without a customer's knowledge to send millions of pieces of SpamTCP 80 (www)Customers running a Web server will no longer be able to have Internet users connect to their serverCommon exploit on old Window IIS server and Linux boxes that are not properly patchedTCP 110 (pop3)Customers running a POP mail server will no longer be able to have Internet users connect to the serverThis prevents mail servers that operate as an open relay. Open relays are used without a customer's knowledge to send millions of pieces of SpamTCP 6667 (ircd)Customers running an IRC server (Internet Relay Chat) will no longer be able to have Internet users connect to the serverTCP/UDP 135-139 (dcom and netbios)These ports are commonly exploited by worm viruses135 Windows RPC136 PROFILE Naming System (basically unused)137-139 Windows NetBiosTCP/UDP 443 (ssl)Customers will not be able to accept inbound ssl connections on this portCustomer IP Point Of Sale (IP POS) devices are not blocked. No need for a Server plan for IP POSTCP/UDP 445 (ms-ds)Microsoft Directory Services - customers that allow legitimate Internet users access to their computers will lose this abilityThis allows hackers to directly connect to a Windows based computer and gain total control over the OSTCP/UDP 1433-1434 (ms-sql)Microsoft SQL server - Customers running an SQL server will no longer be able to have Internet users connect to their serverThere are several worm viruses that exploit holes in SQL serverContactQuestions?If you have any questions about this Acceptable Use Policy, please e-mail TELUS at abuse@telus.com.Related articlesBusiness Internet Service Terms Business Internet and DSL Service Terms Office Internet Service TermsTELUS HSIA Security Measures PolicyInternet service and rate updatesDid this article solve your problem?YesNoYour AgreementGeneral Terms and Conditions - Canada Business Connect terms & conditionsBusiness Connect Service Terms - eContractBusiness Internet Service Terms Business Internet and DSL Service Terms DID Service TermsG Suite eContracts - Service TermsHigh Speed Internet Access (HSIA) Service TermsBusiness Long Distance "BLD" Service TermsManaged Cloud Security - Service TermsManaged Guest WiFi  Managed Premise as a Service (MPAAS)  eContract Terms Microsoft 365 delivered by TELUS - Service TermsMobile Malware Detection (MMD) eContract - Service TermsNetwork as a Service (NAAS) - Service Terms Office Phone Service – Service Terms Business TV Hospitality + Hospitality Wi-Fi Service Terms TELUS Network Access Management - Service Terms Local Business Lines Service TermsAudio Conference Service TermsTELUS Bill Analyzer Premium Service Terms TC2 Pro Service Terms TELUS Dedicated Office Internet TermsTELUS Network as a Service - Service TermsTELUS Office Essentials Service TermsTELUS Partner Hub Services TermsTELUS Wavelength Service TermsPre-authorized payment plan terms and conditionsRegulated Service Terms (Tariff)TELUS Bill Analyzer Service -  Terms and Conditions Business Connect Service Terms - SECTION A: GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONSBusiness Connect Service Terms - SECTION B: GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONSTELUS Business Connect™ Terms and Conditions Mobile EditionG Suite eContracts - Service Terms Microsoft 365 delivered by TELUS - Service TermsInternet Fax - Terms and ConditionsBusiness Internet Service Terms Business Internet and DSL Service Terms Office Internet Service TermsTELUS HSIA Security Measures PolicyInternet service and rate updatesThe Internet Code of Conduct Acceptable Use PolicyBusiness Internet Bundles - Additional Service TermsBusiness Internet Dedicated Terms and Conditions Unmanaged High Speed Internet - Service Terms And ConditionsTELUS Business Antivirus Service TermsTELUS DNS Security Service TermsRaven solution - Service TermsManaged Cloud Security - Service TermsManaged Guest WiFi  Managed Premise as a Service (MPAAS)  eContract TermsNetwork as a Service (NAAS) - Service Terms MITS Hosting Services eContract - Service TermsDrive+ Service TermsMobility Service TermsWi-Fi Calling terms and conditionsTELUS Fair Use PolicyMobile Malware Detection (MMD) eContract - Service TermsTELUS Corporate Mobility Customers - Terms and ConditionsAutomatic account withdrawals – terms of serviceTELUS Boost Wi-Fi Easy Payment Terms and ConditionsView and download Customer Service Agreements in My TELUSDID Service TermsOffice Phone Service – Service Terms Local Business Line Service TermsTELUS Long Distance Service TermsUnregulated Local Telephone Service TermsBusiness Long Distance Service TermsLocal Business Line Service - Terms of ServiceOffice Phone Service – Terms and ConditionsTELUS Secure Business Terms – A.
