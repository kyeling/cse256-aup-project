Our forums are here for the enjoyment and benefit of all participants and users and is accessible to all who register and are 13 years of age or older.  Our forum is most valuable when everyone obeys certain basic guidelines and rules for online behavior.  Our AUP is presented here so that everyone understands the ground rules of use and collaboration when using our forum. By registering you agree to comply with this AUP, in addition to our Legal Terms of Use.  We may change our AUP at any time, and our changes shall be effective immediately.  Your use of our forums after our changes are posted shall be deemed to constitute your acceptance of the changes.
We may, in our sole discretion, determine whether a use of our forum is a violation of this policy. While it is not our intent to control or censor communications of participants, if we become aware of a violation of this policy, we make take such action as we deem appropriate to address such violation.

We provide our forums to you to facilitate collaboration between our users and customers regarding our products and services.  Please stay on point — refrain from discussing personal matters, abusing any company or product, or, in general, from posting content that is not related to Synopsys products or services.  Our forum is not a legal venue, and as such any discussion of litigation or potential litigation (past, present, future or otherwise) is not permitted and automatically regarded as off-point.
Respect Each Other.
We want everyone to have a positive experience while participating in our forums. It is your responsibility to make sure that you are not detracting from any of our other user’s experience in our forums.

We make no guarantee regarding, and we assume no liability for, the security and integrity of any data or information you store or transmit via the forums or the Internet, including any data or information stored or transmitted by any computer designated as “secure.” You are responsible for immediately reporting to us any issue which could compromise the security or integrity of any User or system taking part in the use of our forums.
