Interactive services
We may from time to time provide interactive services on this site, or access or links to interactive services provided by third parties from this site, including, without limitation:
Chat rooms.
Bulletin boards.
Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical). In the event we provide access or links to interactive services, provided by third parties, from this site, we are under no obligation to provide, and are not responsible for providing, any information about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical)
and you should satisfy yourself about those issues by checking the relevant information provided by the relevant third party(s).
In the event we provide access or links to interactive services provided by third parties from this site, you should inform yourself about the content standards and rules applicable to those interactive services and you must comply with those standards and rules.
We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on this site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we am under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on,, or which can be linked to from, this site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our, or any applicable, content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.
Although our site is not intended for use by children, the use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. The use of any interactive services, provided by third parties, to which we provide access or link to from this site, by a minor may or may not be subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use any interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.
Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.
