Complaints about customers of any such reseller or downstream service provider shall be forwarded to such reseller or downstream service provider for resolution. If at any time PurePeak determines that such reseller or downstream service provider is not taking appropriate action in accordance with this Acceptable Use Policy, PurePeak shall work with such reseller or downstream service provider to review their policies and enforcement procedures.
