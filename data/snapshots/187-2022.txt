Lightpath reserves the right to modify the AUP at any time and any such modification shall be automatically effective as to all users when adopted by Lightpath. Each Customer of the Service is responsible for ensuring that the use of all Services provided complies with this AUP. Any user who does not agree to be bound by these terms should immediately stop their use of the Service.1. Illegal UseThe Service may be used only for lawful purposes.

The communication does not necessarily have to pass through the Service’s email infrastructure – it only needs to originate from a service user.
