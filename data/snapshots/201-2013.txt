We all know that the Internet is a wide-open place to explore, learn, and have fun.  We want to help make sure that you can do that safely, securely, and privately.  At AVAST, we like to believe that everyone has the best of intentions and clearly knows where the lines of right and wrong are drawn in the sand of the Internet.  Help us make sure that the web stays a great place to spend your time by not doing things that authorities would view as illegal or inappropriate.  So please don’t use our service to send or receive pirated movies or music, send defamatory material or do something bad like that . If we see anything that is over the line, we are obligated to turn it over to the authorities and we may have to shut off your access.  Be responsible citizens and just do the right things while using AVAST products!  If you see anything bad going on, fire off an email to
