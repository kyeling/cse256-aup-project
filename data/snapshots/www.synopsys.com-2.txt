By registering you agree to comply with this AUP, in addition to our Legal Terms of Use.  We may change our AUP at any time, and our changes shall be effective immediately.  Your use of our forums after our changes are posted shall be deemed to constitute your acceptance of the changes.
We may, in our sole discretion, determine whether a use of our forum is a violation of this policy. While it is not our intent to control or censor communications of participants, if we become aware of a violation of this policy, we make take such action as we deem appropriate to address such violation.

We want everyone to have a positive experience while participating in our forums. It is your responsibility to make sure that you are not detracting from any of our other user’s experience in our forums.

We welcome your opinions and advice, but personal attacks and harassment of other users using our forum or through private messaging are not acceptable.

We retain the right to remove any posts or information we deem inconsistent with our AUP.
Violations of our AUP.
We do not edit or monitor User content posted in our forums.  However, we retain the right, at our sole discretion, to limit or deny your access to our forums and to remove any material posted by you that, in our sole judgment, does not comply with our policies or that we otherwise deem to be inappropriate for our forums.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not responsible for any failure or delay in removing such material.  We may involve, and will cooperate with, law enforcement if we suspect criminal activity, and we shall have no liability to you or any third party for any actions taken in connection with such cooperation.  Our employees and all Users of our forums are responsible for providing assistance to us in such investigations as needed.
