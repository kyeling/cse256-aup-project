Acceptable Use Policy
Date: 4th July 2018
1. Acceptable Use Policy
1.1. This acceptable use policy sets out the terms between you and us under which you may access our websites, mobile applications and digital platforms (“the Services”). For the purposes of this acceptable use policy “we”, “us” , “our” and “BRE” means:
a) BRE Group Limited, a company registered in England and Wales under company number 02704081, and with a registered office of Bucknalls Lane, Garston, Watford, WD25 9XX; and
b) any BRE Group Limited subsidiary as defined under Section 1159, Companies Act 2006.
1.2. Your use of the Services means that you accept, and agree to abide by, all the policies in this acceptable use policy together with our Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy and Terms of Use Policy.
2. Prohibited uses
2.1. You may use the Services only for lawful purposes. You may not use the Services:
a) in any way that breaches any applicable local, national or international law or regulation.
b) in any way that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any unlawful or fraudulent purpose or effect.
c) for the purpose of harming or attempting to harm minors in any way.
d) to send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not comply with our content standards.
e) to transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar solicitation (spam).
f) to knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code designed to adversely affect the operation of any computer software or hardware.
2.2. You also agree:
a) not to reproduce, duplicate, copy or re-sell any part of the Services in contravention of the provisions of our terms of use policy.
b) not to access without authority, interfere with, damage or disrupt:
(i) any part of the Services;
(ii) any equipment or network on which the Services are stored;
(iii) any software used in the provision of the Services; or
(iv) any equipment or network or software owned or used by any third party.
3. Interactive Service
3.1. We may from time to time provide interactive services on the Services, including, without limitation:
a) chat rooms;
b) bulletin boards;
c) forums;
d) online training courses, conferences or seminars;
e) comments features;
f) live stream video features; and
g) blog services.
3.2. Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).
3.3. We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on the Services, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on the Services, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.
3.4. The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool-proof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.
3.5. Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise
4. Content standards

a) contain any material which is defamatory of any person;

n) advocate, promote or assist any unlawful act such as (by way of example only) copyright infringement or computer misuse.
5. Data Protection
Where You make use of a function on our website in which you can upload content and such content contains “Personal Data” (as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679), You warrant that you have all necessary consents from the individual concerned, to upload their Personal Data.  That Personal Data shall be processed in accordance with the BRE Group Privacy Policy.
