SUSPENSION AND/OR TERMINATION OF WIRELESS SERVICE
Cricket Wireless LLC ("Cricket") has created this Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") to encourage the responsible and reasonable use of Cricket's networks, systems, services, websites and products (collectively, the "Cricket Network and Services") by the users ("Users") of the Cricket Network and Services.  By using the Cricket Network and Services, you agree to be bound by the terms of this AUP.  Cricket reserves the right to change or modify this AUP at any time, with any such changes or modifications effective when posted to Cricket's website, www.cricketwireless.com.  Use of the Cricket Network and Services after any such change or modification constitutes your acceptance of the change or modification to this AUP.
This AUP encompasses Cricket Network and Services using the new Cricket GSM network as well as the legacy Cricket CDMA network. You are a legacy Cricket CDMA customer if you have not migrated to the new Cricket GSM network and you purchased service from Cricket before May 18, 2014, or you are a Lifeline customer, or you purchased Cricket service in Walmart or Radio Shack for use on Cricket?s CDMA network.
DATA SERVICES
Unlimited Data Plans
Cricket's Basic, Smart and Pro rate plans include unlimited data access.  Each plan also includes a specific amount of high speed data access that enables you to browse, download and stream at full speeds (among other factors, your data speeds will depend on your device type and available coverage (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, 4G LTE)).  If you are a current Cricket customer you can see how much high speed data access is included with your plan by logging into your account using the My Cricket app on your smartphone or by going online at www.cricketwireless.com. If you are not a current Cricket customer you can see how much high speed data access is included in our current rate plan offerings by gong to www.cricketwireless.com/shop/plans.
Reduced Data Speeds on Unlimited Data Plans
We continuously measure your data usage to determine if your total usage, as aggregated over your monthly service period, exceeds the amount of high speed data access for your rate plan.  If you run out of high speed data access during any monthly service period, you will still be able to use the data service, but your data access speeds will be reduced to a maximum 128 kbps until the end of your monthly service period.  Once you begin your next month of service, your high speed data access will reset and you will once again have access to download speeds up to 4 Mbps on our 4G HSPA+ service or up to 8 Mbps with our LTE service.
To find out how much high speed access you have used during your monthly service period, log into your account using the My Cricket app on your smartphone or by going online at www.cricketwireless.com.
We will also notify you by text message when you have used approximately 75% of the high speed data access allocated to your plan during the monthly service period.
Using Wi-fi can help you avoid reduced speeds.  Speeds are not reduced while connected via Wi-Fi, and data activity over Wi-Fi does not count toward the high speed data usage threshold.  Please consider using your Cricket Wi-Fi app to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots.
Mobile Broadband Information
Please visit Cricket's Mobile Broadband Information page which provides information about network practices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms applicable to our mobile broadband Internet access services, consistent with the Federal Communications Commission?s Open Internet rules.
Measuring Data Usage
Certain activities, such as downloading a full length movie or downloading large quantities of music files use more data.  Consider the following estimate in determining how much high speed access is sufficient for you:  One (1) Gigabyte (GB) of data is enough data to send or receive approximately 1000 emails with attachments, 500 web page views, 400 Facebook/Twitter/Pinterest posts with pictures, 30 app downloads, 15 hours of streaming music and 5 hours of streaming video each month.  Actual usage will vary.
Wi-Fi access does not count against your high speed data access.  Please consider using your Cricket Wi-Fi app to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots.
Purchasing More High Speed Data Access
If you have used all of your high speed data access and that you need more high speed access before your next monthly service period, you can purchase additional high speed access for use during your current month's service period by logging into your Cricket account from your smartphone or by visiting us online at www.cricketwireless.com.
To purchase more high speed data access for use on the legacy Cricket CDMA Network, you can purchase "pay as you go" full speed data, or additional full speed data at https://account.mycricket.com.
