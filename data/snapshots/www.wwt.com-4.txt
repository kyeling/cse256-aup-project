TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify WWT's acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. WWT reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. WWT also reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. All orders placed over $2000.00 (U.S.) must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and fraud avoidance department. WWT may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.

Return authorization, for all other returns not fitting into the non-conforming category or returned after the initial 5-day period, shall be at WWT's sole discretion. All approved returns are subject to a re-stocking fee of 15% of the product's original selling price.Once contacted, the Customer Service representative will provide you with an RMA number and inform you of where to send your merchandise. Please write the RMA number on your packing skip and include the original packing slip with your return. C.O.D. returns will not be accepted. The RMA number will be honored for only one (1) order and must match the product authorized for return. The RMA number will be valid for thirty (30), twenty (20) or fifteen (15) days from the date the RMA was issued by WWT, depending on the RMA policy of the OEM or Distributor from which the specific item was ordered. Merchandise should be returned in its original packaging along with any certifications, instructions, etc. You are responsible for all shipping costs of product that has not been determined to be non-conforming (according to the definition above).Software returns will be accepted for refund only if the product is unopened.

All refunds for non-defective items exclude shipping and handling charges. Please allow 2-4 weeks for refunds to be processed and credited to your account. If you are seeking a replacement of any software, please follow the RMA procedures set forth above. All items returned must be in "as-new" condition, in original packaging and with all warranty cards, manuals and accessories. The original packaging slip must be included and the RMA number visible on the package. Failure to follow these instructions could result in a delay or partial forfeiture of your refund.
