Cricket Wireless LLC ("Cricket," "we," "us," or "our") has created this Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") to encourage the responsible and reasonable use of Cricket's networks, systems, services, websites and products (collectively, the "Cricket Network and Services") by the users ("Users") of the Cricket Network and Services.  By using the Cricket Network and Services, you agree to be bound by the terms of this AUP.  Cricket reserves the right to change or modify this AUP at any time without advance notice, with any such changes or modifications effective when posted to Cricket's website, www.cricketwireless.com. Use of the Cricket Network and Services after any such change or modification constitutes your acceptance of the change or modification to this AUP. "Device" means any compatible basic phone, smartphone, or tablet that we or a Cricket authorized retail location provide or sell to you, or you provide, and we authorize you to use with a Cricket SIM card on your account.
DATA SERVICES
Data Speeds on All Plans
High-speed data access on Cricket's network allows download speeds of a maximum 8 Mbps for compatible 4G LTE Devices and 4 Mbps for compatible 4G HSPA+ Devices.
Reduced Data Speeds on $30/2 GB, and $40/5 GB Data Plans
Cricket's $30/2 GB, and $40/5 GB rate plans include 2 GB, and 5 GB, of high-speed data access, respectively, that enables you to browse, download and stream at full speeds (among other factors, your data speeds will depend on your Device type and available coverage (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, 4G LTE) until your high-speed data access is used. If you run out of high-speed data access during any monthly service period, your data access speeds will be reduced to a maximum 128 kbps until the end of your monthly service period. Once you begin your next month of service, your high-speed data access will reset and you will once again have access to download speeds up to 4 Mbps on our 4G HSPA+ service or up to 8 Mbps with our 4G LTE service.  If you are a current Cricket customer you can see how much high-speed data access is included with your plan and how much you have used by logging into your account using the myCricket app on your smartphone or by accessing your account online at www.cricketwireless.com/myaccount; we will also notify you by text message when you have used approximately 75% of the high-speed data access allocated to your plan during the monthly service period. If you are not a current Cricket customer you can see how much high-speed data access is included in our current rate plan offerings by visiting to www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans. Starting April 2, 2017, and for all rate plans, Cricket will begin launching Stream More, a feature which helps you save data when watching videos by streaming certain higher-definition videos at standard definition quality, similar to DVD (about 480p).  Cricket will begin activating Stream More starting April 2, 2017, and continue during the coming months.  Once activated, you may turn it off or back on at any time. Learn how. To learn more about when Cricket will turn on Stream More for you, visit Important Information Regarding Data Speed, Usage and Network Management. For more information on Stream More or Cricket?s mobile broadband service visit www.cricketwireless.com/mobilebroadband.
Using Wi-Fi can help you avoid reduced speeds.  Speeds are not reduced while connected via Wi-Fi, and data activity over Wi-Fi does not count toward the high speed data usage threshold.  Please consider using your Cricket Wi-Fi app to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots.
Mobile Broadband Information
Please visit Cricket's Mobile Broadband Information page which provides information about network practices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms applicable to our mobile broadband Internet access services, consistent with the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet rules.
Measuring Data Usage
Certain activities, such as downloading a full length movie or downloading large quantities of music files use more data.  Consider the following estimate in determining how much high speed access is sufficient for you:  One (1) Gigabyte (GB) of data is enough data to send or receive approximately 1000 emails with attachments, 500 web page views, 400 Facebook/Twitter/Pinterest posts with pictures, 30 app downloads, 15 hours of streaming music and 5 hours of streaming video each month.  Actual usage will vary.
Wi-Fi access does not count against your high speed data access.  Please consider using your Cricket Wi-Fi app to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots.
Purchasing More High-Speed Data Access
If you have used all of your high-speed data access and you need more high-speed access before your next monthly service period, you can purchase additional high-speed data access for use during your current month's service period by logging into your Cricket account from your Device or by visiting us online at www.cricketwireless.com/myaccount.
