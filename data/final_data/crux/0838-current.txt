Microsoft is not responsible for the content of any user-created posting, listing or message. The decision to view content or engage with others is yours. We advise you to use your judgment.
You are responsible for protecting your computer against interference, spyware or viruses that may be encountered for downloaded items from the service. This Service can help you secure your computers from malware and virus threats with Intune Endpoint Protection. But, even if you decide not to use this Service’s endpoint protection, we always recommend that you install a virus protection program on your computer and keep it up to date.
Information you provide or upload to the Services may be stored outside of the country in which you reside.
Your use of any Service administered through this site is governed by the terms and conditions of the agreement(s) under which you purchased the Service. You can obtain a copy of your agreement(s) by contacting Intune Support.
If Microsoft believes that unauthorized or improper use is being made of the Service, it may, without notice and at its sole discretion, take such action as it deems appropriate, including blocking messages from a particular internet domain, mail server or IP address. Violation of this Policy can lead to termination of a customer's account.
Customers who (1) participate in the Services’ “Communities” for support; or (2) obtain third level domain names to be used with the Service, are additionally subject to the restrictions in the Code of Conduct.
Microsoft reserves the right to amend or change the Policy of any service at any time without notice. We encourage you to periodically review these guidelines to ensure you are in compliance.
Nothing in this policy is intended to grant any rights in the Service. Failure to enforce this Policy in every instance does not amount to a waiver of Microsoft's rights.
