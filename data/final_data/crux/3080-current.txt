Skip to Contentntl recently posted a revised Acceptable Use Policy for its internet services, and contained within this document was a controversial paragraph which reads:"The running of servers via your dial-up or broadband connection is not
permitted. If ntl become aware that servers are being run via the connection
supplied by ntl the account may be subject to immediate suspension or
termination."This ambiguous statement led many subscribers to question what exactly ntl meant by the term "server".  Today, the AUP team gave a list of services not allowed to be run by customers on ntl's internet service... which hasn't been particularly well received by subscribers.Services not allowed:
Web serversSMTP, POP, IMAP mail serversNews serversFTP serversGames serversMedia servers (e.g. Napster)Streaming media serversProxy serversRemote adminstration serversDNS serversDHCP serversX serversTelnet serversSSH serversPrint serversTFTP ServersMessaging serversMUD serversICQ serversChat serversIRC serversDatabase serversFile and Printer sharing (e.g. the Windows Networking service)They do say, however, that customers are allowed to run ICQ and chat software.A couple of comments from ntl's subscribers, taken from ntl.support.cablemodems:"Who can we write to about this? Other than ntl and The Register, both of
whom I'm about to email. I mean, given the political rhetoric being
bandied around about the broadband revolution, it really is too much
that Britain's largest single provider of broadband services isn't
willing to actually let you use it for anything." - Glyndwr"This is not the service I initially signed up for, being *considerably* more
restricted, but as you seem to have the monopoly on broadband in my area you
think you can force this Draconian change on us without any opposition from
your 'customers'."For a company which claims to 'listen to it's customers views' you show very
little signs of doing so. Just what are you afraid of? We PAY for the bandwidth
allocated to us, just what gives you the *moral* right to stop us using it for
what we want? Providing, of course, that it's not used for business (not SOHO)
use, the availability of illegal/copyrighted material nor an open (spam magnet)
mail relay." - Colin JonesIt will be most interesting to see how ntl responds to these statements, and whether they will consider that such restrictions are unwieldy and look quite out of place in today's era of broadband internet technologies.Watch Next CableYouTube channel launches on Virgin TiVoVirgin Movies gets multi-device playbackVirgin Media ends year with 4.9m customersLiberty Global acquires Virgin MediaAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowBBC revamps TV Red ButtonVirgin Media launches TV AnywhereVirgin Media boosts top broadband speedVirgin Media to launch TV Anywhere serviceVirgin launches budget Classic CollectionTube WiFi carries over 8m Olympic momentsVirgin Media unveils gadget beach hutVirgin's TiVo hits 1m customers markAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below
